# Clock Program  ‚è∞

## Overview
This program demonstrates the functionality of a clock using the `clockType` class. It includes operations to set time, increment hours and minutes, check for equality between two clocks, and print the time.

## Files
- `clockType.h`: Header file defining the `clockType` class and its member functions.
- `main.cpp`: Main program file containing the demonstration code for the `clockType` class.

## Getting Started
To run the program:
1. Ensure all files (`clockType.h` and `main.cpp`) are in the same directory.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage
- The program initializes a clock (`clockType` object) and demonstrates basic functionalities.
- Some functionalities are commented out in the `main` function for demonstration purposes. Uncomment sections as needed to explore different operations of the clock.
- Operations include printing the day, time, setting time, incrementing minutes/hours, and checking equality between clocks.

## Functionality
- `printDay()`: Prints the current day 
- `printTime()`: Prints the current time of the clock.
- `setTime(int hours, int minutes, int seconds)`: Sets the time of the clock to the provided values.
- `incrementMinute()`: Increments the time by one minute.
- `incrementHour()`: Increments the time by one hour.
- `equalTime(clockType otherClock)`: Checks if the current clock time is equal to another clock's time.

## Notes
- Additional functionalities and class methods might be available in the `clockType` class but are not demonstrated in this code snippet.
- Uncomment specific sections in the `main` function to explore different functionalities.
